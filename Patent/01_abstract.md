# Abstract

A software application for controlling and monitoring test and measurement instruments, such as RF spectrum analyzers. The application features a novel method for dynamically generating a graphical user interface (GUI) at runtime by interpreting the directory and file structure of the application's installation folder. The GUI's layout, including panes, tabs, and content, is determined by the folder hierarchy, allowing for significant UI customization without modifying the core application code. The application employs a decoupled, message-driven architecture where distinct software components (managers, workers, and display) communicate asynchronously via an MQTT message bus. A command abstraction protocol, 'YAK', is used to translate abstract, application-level commands into the specific command language of the connected instrument, enabling adaptability to different hardware models. This combination of a filesystem-driven GUI and a decoupled, message-driven architecture with command abstraction provides a highly modular, extensible, and user-friendly solution for instrument control and data visualization.
