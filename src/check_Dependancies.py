# src/check_Dependancies.py
#
# This file contains a standalone function to check for and install necessary
# Python dependencies. It is designed to be run as the very first step
# when the application starts, ensuring the environment is ready before
# the GUI or any other modules are loaded.

# Version 20250801.2 (Removed all Tkinter dependencies. Dependency checks now
#                     use print() for output and input() for user confirmation,
#                     making it a pure command-line operation. Updated debug_print
#                     fallback for early execution.)

import subprocess
import sys
import inspect # For debug_print
import os # For debug_print

# Import debug_print from utils.utils_instrument_control
# We need a way to print debug messages before the main app's console is ready.
# For this specific function, we'll use a fallback print if debug_print isn't available yet.

    from utils.utils_instrument_control import debug_print

        # In this very early stage, console_print_func won't be available,
        # so we just print directly to stdout/stderr.
        print(f"üö´üêõ [DEBUG] {file} - {function}: {message}")


def check_and_install_dependencies(current_version):
    # Function Description:
    # Checks for necessary Python packages (pyvisa, pandas, beautifulsoup4, pdfplumber, requests)
    # and attempts to install them if missing. If packages are missing and the user agrees,
    # it installs them and then exits the application, prompting for a restart.
    # This function is designed to be called *before* the main Tkinter application
    # is initialized, ensuring all dependencies are met. It operates purely via
    # command-line interaction (print/input) without any GUI elements.
    #
    # Inputs:
    #   current_version (str): The current version string of the application for logging.
    #
    # Process:
    #   1. Defines a dictionary of required dependencies (import name: package name).
    #   2. Iterates through the dependencies, attempting to import each.
    #   3. If an ImportError occurs, adds the package name to a `missing_dependencies` list.
    #   4. If `missing_dependencies` is not empty, prompts the user to install them
    #      via command-line `input()`.
    #   5. If the user agrees, attempts to install using `pip`.
    #   6. Prints success/failure messages to the console and exits the application
    #      if installation occurs or if the user declines installation/installation fails.
    #
    # Outputs:
    #   None. May exit the application if dependencies are missing or installed.
    #
    # (2025-08-01) Change: Removed Tkinter dependencies. Now uses print() and input()
    #                      for all user interaction.
