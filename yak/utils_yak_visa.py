# tabs/Instrument/utils_yak_visa.py
#
# This file provides utility functions for safe and standardized execution of
# VISA commands (GET, SET, DO) on connected instruments. It wraps PyVISA operations
# with error handling and integrates with the application's debug logging.
# NOTE: The high-level command execution logic (e.g., `execute_visa_command`) has been
# moved to the new `Yakety_Yak.py` file to separate concerns and improve modularity.
# This file now focuses exclusively on low-level, safe read/write operations.
