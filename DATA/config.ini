[Amplifier]
selected_amplifier_type = Band-Specific Amplifier
amplifier_description = Designed to amplify signals only within a specific frequency band, often incorporating built-in filters to reject out-of-band interference.
amplifier_use = Targeted amplification for specific TV channels, cellular bands, or radio services, where interference from other bands is a concern.
